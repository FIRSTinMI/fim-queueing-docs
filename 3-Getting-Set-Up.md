# Getting Set Up

Getting your displays set up is super easy:

1. Go to <https://fim-queueing.web.app>
2. Log in with the event key you were provided
3. Click on the screen you wish to show
4. Repeat as much as you'd like

Once your event moves from qualification matches into playoffs, you'll probably want to show a different, more relevant, screen. Click the back to home button and select something else.

## Having Issues?

If you run in to any issues getting the display up and running, or your event needed to regenerate its schedule after publishing it, let one of the FIM Queueing administrators know. They have remote management capabilities over all connected displays, so they can:

1. Remotely change the screen a given display is on
2. Refresh displays
3. Reload event schedules

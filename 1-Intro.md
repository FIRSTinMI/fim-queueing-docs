# Introduction

FIM Queueing is a tool that FRC events can use on pit displays to give teams and other pit staff access to information about the current status of the event. This is achieved by having multiple "screens" which the event staff can choose based on what would be most useful to them and those around them. These screens include:

- A queueing display, which shows the match on the field, on deck, and the three matches following for both qualification and playoff
- A bracket for playoffs (8 alliance, double elimination)
- A scrolling rankings display, which shows team placement and game-specific details
- A full screen embed of the event's live stream

# Event Eligibility

Because FIM Queueing works over the internet, a few things are required for your event to be eligible.

1. You must have a stable internet connection in the pit.
    - Or wherever you are placing your displays. A direct connection to the field is not required.
2. Your field should publish match schedules to FRC HQ.
    - TBA Sync is coming for offseason events, but not yet available.
    - If your field is not able to publish schedules, it can be worked around. See [Manually Running Quals](#manually-running-quals) TODO MAKE THIS SECTION

To use the playoff displays:

1. Your event must have 8 alliances and be using double elimination.
    - If your event does not meet this requirement, we recommend showing the livestream on your pit display instead.
2. Your field must be continuously syncing with FRC HQ.
    - Once again, TBA Sync is coming. It must be continuous because playoff schedules change as winners are determined.

FIRST in Michigan events are automatically enrolled in FIM Queueing. If you are running an event outside of the FIM district, get in touch to have your event added at no cost.
